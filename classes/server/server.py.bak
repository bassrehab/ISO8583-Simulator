'''
a Server class that handles socket connections
- Runs continuously.
- On receiving a request data, transfer control to the Controller.
- Controller will take the raw ISO message, pass it to ISO8583,
    do internal processing and return the prepared response (text) back to server.
- Server will pack the message in ASCII/ByteArray format and send the response back
